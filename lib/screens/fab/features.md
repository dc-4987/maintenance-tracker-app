# Floating Action Button (FAB / iOS “+”)

Primary action: add or record something quickly — a perfect FAB use case  ￼.

FAB menu actions (fan-out on long-press or tap-hold):
	1.	➕ Add asset – create a tool / vehicle / equipment item
	2.	⏱ Log usage – opens a tiny sheet with “asset”, “duration/odometer”, save
	3.	✔️ Quick-task done – mark the next scheduled maintenance complete
	4.	✨ AI setup – invokes the LLM prompt wizard

Limit the menu to 2 – 4 actions per Material guidance to avoid clutter  ￼.
